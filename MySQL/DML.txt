DML (Data Manipulation Language)

DML commands are used to manipulate data within tables: inserting, updating, and deleting rows. These commands can be rolled back (transactional).

1. INSERT (Add new rows to a table)

Example 1: Insert single row

INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age, Branch)
VALUES (1, 'Akshay', 24, 'Computer Science');

Adds one student record.

Example 2: Insert multiple rows

INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age, Branch)
VALUES 
(2, 'Priya', 22, 'Mechanical'),
(3, 'Ramesh', 23, 'Civil');

Adds multiple records in a single query.

2. UPDATE (Modify existing rows)

Example 1: Update a single row

UPDATE Students
SET Age = 25
WHERE StudentID = 1;

Updates age of student with `StudentID = 1`.

Example 2: Update multiple rows

UPDATE Students
SET Branch = 'Electronics'
WHERE Branch = 'Mechanical';

Changes the branch for all students currently in Mechanical.

3. DELETE (Remove rows from a table)

Example 1: Delete a single row

DELETE FROM Students
WHERE StudentID = 3;

Removes the student with `StudentID = 3`.

Example 2: Delete multiple rows

DELETE FROM Students
WHERE Age < 23;

Removes all students younger than 23.

Additional Notes:
* DML commands affect only data, not table structure.
* Can be rolled back if used within a transaction.

START TRANSACTION;

DELETE FROM Students WHERE Age < 23;

ROLLBACK;  -- Undo the deletion

* Always use WHERE clause with UPDATE/DELETE to avoid affecting all rows unintentionally.
